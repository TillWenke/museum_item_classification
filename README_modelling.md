## crossval_randomforest:

This notebook uses cross validation to train randomforest models, including through Gridsearch

## pred_xgboost

In this notebook, a model is trained using xgboost. At the start, the variable rebalanced is set to false and should be set as true if rebalancing via SMOTE should be applied to the train-data.

## pred_random_forest
