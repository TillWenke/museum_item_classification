235961,"in the country. Henn Roode: Salme Reek, 1970 to 1972     Salme Reek (portrait painting), 1970 - 1972. 3/4 portrait painting of Drama Theater actress Salme Reek (1907 - 1996), which can be considered rather ugly, but nevertheless extremely interesting. The actress, who was in her sixties at the time of the painting, looks much older in the portrait. Her facial features are grotesque, and fatigue and signs of wear are emphasized by a grayish color, which does not leave the impression, unlike contemporary memories, that this is a lively lady who behaves according to the behavior patterns of a person much younger than her age. Also, when looking at the painting, it seems incredible that Reek had played, for example, the Nukitsamee or Kuslap from Oskar Lutsu's ""Spring"" on the theater stage only ten years earlier. In Reeg's portrait, the figure and the background tend to merge into one forcefully, and the person being portrayed becomes a part of the interior. Like Roode's portrait of Karl Ader, striking differences emerge between how Roode has portrayed the actress and how her contemporaries have subsequently described her. In the memories, it is recalled that Reek had been the most vivacious and colorful (and sometimes the most annoying) actress in the entire Drama Theater, who also dazzled people half her age with her energy. Perhaps the merging of the figure into the void alludes to the lines of Scripture ""...whom you love, although you have not seen him"" (Pt 1,8). After all, it is common for actors to be known by their roles, to love the characters they play, to be attached to their theatrical side, but the question of who the actor really is, often remains unanswered. So one might think that Roode has perhaps managed to see through Reeg in this portrait, behind his theatrics and perhaps guess a little more of his true nature. /text Liisi Aibel, 2013/  ",country

Fellow fighter!
I have a lot of work at the moment; and cannot create anything in the field of music. I am a singing teacher in two high schools. Turn on its private lessons and choir. Please inform Saare and Neumann that I have nothing to do with solo voices. I wanted to write something to them, but lack of time does not allow. I went to Lihula with my choir. We gave 2 concerts. Now the school children's parties are ahead. I prepare against them. Write now what you think about ""Meie err"". Is it worth wasting the choir's time on this? - In the near future I will send you the lyrics of three spiritual songs. (""Now God Sends Happiness"", ""I Know a Wicked Land"" and ""Oh Retreat My Fears""). I haven't written anything yet this year. The feather rusts.
What are you doing? Greetings to the disciples of Tallinn music, in this difficult time of ""trial"". CKreek.  ","letter, postcard"

2849059,"Photo on the album page   The photos come from the collections of the A. M. Luther factory (later TVMK) museum. In 2004, the company Ars Projekt OÜ signed an agreement with representatives of TVMK (Tallinn Vineeri- ja Möblikombinaat) to redesign the factory complex into a residential quarter. By that time, the historical factory was in a dilapidated state, the exhibits of the factory museum were neglected and scattered, in addition to this, the museum premises were said to have been flooded. The transferred materials also come from there. The transferor noticed the photos while exploring the premises of the factory and asked the customer's representative to use them to get to know the past of the historic building complex as thoroughly as possible. Since the customer had no interest and desire to preserve or exhibit the photos himself, the transferor considered it right to hand them over to the Architecture Museum (2008) after being used in the design. Anne Lass, chief treasurer of the Museum of Architecture, handed over the photos to the Estonian History Museum in October 2014 on the grounds that the material does not meet the collection principles of the Museum of Architecture.

The collection consists of album fragments (photos are pasted on cardboard sheets) and individual photos gathered in three envelopes. The collection is bound together between quick binding covers.
The photos show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s. The four oldest photos show the construction of the factory's new buildings in 1912. The most recent photos are from 1965 (4 pieces), which depict the events of the factory collective. A collection of album excerpts from the museum of the former Tallinn Vineeri- and Mööblikombinaat, bound in a swing binder. Contains 323 photos pasted on album pages from probably 7 different albums. The pictures show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called.

2080397,"Dead draft horses.  glass negative. The (partial) collection of glass negatives that belonged to the heritage of home researcher and photo collector Valdeko Vende probably originally came from the premises of Suur-Karja 9 in Tallinn. Many glass negatives can be identified as being photographed by Alendander Teppor in the 1920s-1930s, who also had a photo studio in the same building in the second half of the 1930s. The negatives have been kept in the manufacturer's boxes, partly divided thematically. The notebooks in the boxes indicate that V.Vende has made contact copies of many of them.
The transferor Rita Hillermaa is the daughter of Valdeko Vende.
Content of the collection: Tallinn buildings and city views, Estonian orchestras and artists, athletes, action photography, nature views, photomontages, photography of works of art. Date: 1920s-1930s. 2 are flat film negatives, the rest are glass negatives. The negatives were photographed around 1925-1939. 100 negatives are of interest to the museum in terms of content. Among the remaining 184, there are unidentified landscape views, unsuccessful (foggy) architectural photography, action photography with the same person, many reproductions of photos, paintings, drawings, posters, sculptures with different content. However, primary is the collection value, as individual negatives may contain clues as to the original origin of the rest of the negatives. Transferred by: Rita Hillermaa. From Valdeko Vende's legacy.  ",photo negative

The materials left by him also went to the Estonian Maritime Museum, the Estonian War Museum and the Tartu Flight College and into the hands of Toomas Mürki.

Johannes Tilk was born on April 12, 1943 in Leis municipality, Saaremaa. After graduating from Leis secondary school, Johannes Tilk entered the Kirsanov (Tambov obl.) Flight Technical School, after graduating in 1965, he started working for the Tallinn Aeroflot Estonian civil aviation government as an aircraft mechanic.
In 1968, he graduated from the Higher Flight Training Courses in Kirovograd as an aircraft mechanic, and a year later he continued his training in Ulyanovsk. He was the first in Estonia to become a Tu-134A flight mechanic. In 1985, Johannes retired from Aeroflot for years of service, having flown more than 10,000 flight hours on Il-14, Tu-124 and Tu-134 aircraft.
Then, Johannes Tilk worked for a few years as a mechanic-adjuster in the model fishing collective farm named Kirov and in the years 1989-1993 in the Estonian Agricultural Project.
In 1991, Johannes Tilk returned to aviation. He became a technical instructor and lecturer in the Ülenurme aviation class. He has given lectures at the Aviation College of Tartu. From February 2000 to August 2010, Johannes Tilk worked at the Aviation Authority as a senior inspector of the aviation engineering department. Recently, Johannes Tilk worked on bringing the seaplane hangar back to life at Lennusadam.
Throughout his life, Johannes Tilk collected invaluable historical material about the development of aviation in Estonia, which he gladly shared with everyone who was interested in it. Together with Toivo Kitvel and Vello Lääne, he published the books: ""Time, Men, Airplanes"", ""Estonian Aviation Chronicle"", ""Who's Who in Estonian Aviation"". His merits as a researcher and archiver of the history of aviation have been recognized by the Estonian state with the Valgetähe IV class decoration. His great hobby was making models of old airplanes.  date on postmark: 3. X 34  ","photo, postcard"

3219269,"Franz Ivani p. Schaknaitis was born on 07.12.1861 in Suwalki Governorate (formerly Poland, now Lithuania), Wladyslawow (now in Kudirkos Naumiestis). The family had been large and Franz decided to come to Estonia in search of a better life, whether any of the family members were with him, probably, but the facts are not known.
On 17.05.1893, he married Elise Marie Kruberg, who came from Nehatu municipality (born 05.08.1868), father Kaarel Kristjan (Carl Cristoph) Kruberg (Kruuberg) and mother Truuto Kallamees.

Elise Marie Kruuberg was a trader at the market, she bought fish from fishermen and resold it at the market, she made good money and together they built a house for her family on Köie street, which was completed in 1898, since trading on the market was profitable, then a sales point was opened in the courtyard of Köie street.
Franz certainly also worked, but where and as whom, there is currently no information about this.
The family was large, the first born Jan-Jusef (09.11.1894 in Tallinn), Aleksei, Felix, Marzelia-Maria, Leonarda, Kwirina(Irina), Olga Rosalie and Anton.

Jan-Jusef Schaknaitis (later Estonianized surname Rooveer) received a 4th-grade education at Tallinn City School and secondary school education at Nikolai Gymnasium. One of the ways to earn a living was pantomime, from that time some wall pages have been preserved (Miimis Joonas and Toni). Went in 1919. on the battlefield.

In 1919, Jan-Jusef went to work at the Tallinn Main Customs Office, initially as a guard. By 1932, he became a ship clerk at the customs inspector in Tallinn, where on 03.10.1940 he was laid off due to layoffs.

From 21.10.1940, he started serving in the ENSV Meretransporti Keskus and the Estonian National Shipping Company as a receiver of ships until 31.12.1940, when he was transferred to the Info service of the Maritime Agency, where he served until the German occupation. During the German occupation, he served at Sergo and Co until his death on 27.04.1944. F33037:5  ",photo

2080395,"Promotional image with the title ""Daphne"" - a graphic scene from ancient mythology on the print image.  glass negative. The (partial) collection of glass negatives that belonged to the heritage of home researcher and photo collector Valdeko Vende probably originally came from the premises of Suur-Karja 9 in Tallinn. Many glass negatives can be identified as being photographed by Alendander Teppor in the 1920s-1930s, who also had a photo studio in the same building in the second half of the 1930s. The negatives have been kept in the manufacturer's boxes, partly divided thematically. The notebooks in the boxes indicate that V.Vende has made contact copies of many of them.
The transferor Rita Hillermaa is the daughter of Valdeko Vende.
Content of the collection: Tallinn buildings and city views, Estonian orchestras and artists, athletes, action photography, nature views, photomontages, photography of works of art. Date: 1920s-1930s. 2 are flat film negatives, the rest are glass negatives. The negatives were photographed around 1925-1939. 100 negatives are of interest to the museum in terms of content. Among the remaining 184, there are unidentified landscape views, unsuccessful (foggy) architectural photography, action photography with the same person, many reproductions of photos, paintings, drawings, posters, sculptures with different content. However, primary is the collection value, as individual negatives may contain clues as to the original origin of the rest of the negatives. Transferred by: Rita Hillermaa.

2848924,"Interior view of A. M. Luther factory - worker at production equipment   The photos come from the collections of the A. M. Luther factory (later TVMK) museum. In 2004, the company Ars Projekt OÜ signed an agreement with representatives of TVMK (Tallinn Vineeri- ja Möblikombinaat) to redesign the factory complex into a residential quarter. By that time, the historical factory was in a dilapidated state, the exhibits of the factory museum were neglected and scattered, in addition to this, the museum premises were said to have been flooded. The transferred materials also come from there. The transferor noticed the photos while exploring the premises of the factory and asked the customer's representative to use them to get to know the past of the historic building complex as thoroughly as possible. Since the customer had no interest and desire to preserve or exhibit the photos himself, the transferor considered it right to hand them over to the Architecture Museum (2008) after being used in the design. Anne Lass, chief treasurer of the Museum of Architecture, handed over the photos to the Estonian History Museum in October 2014 on the grounds that the material does not meet the collection principles of the Museum of Architecture.

The collection consists of album fragments (photos are pasted on cardboard sheets) and individual photos gathered in three envelopes. The collection is bound together between quick binding covers.
The photos show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s. The four oldest photos show the construction of the factory's new buildings in 1912. The most recent photos are from 1965 (4 pieces), which depict the events of the factory collective. A collection of album excerpts from the museum of the former Tallinn Vineeri- and Mööblikombinaat, bound in a swing binder. Contains 323 photos pasted on album pages from probably 7 different albums.

The (partial) collection of glass negatives that belonged to the heritage of home researcher and photo collector Valdeko Vende probably originally came from the premises of Suur-Karja 9 in Tallinn. Many glass negatives can be identified as being photographed by Alendander Teppor in the 1920s-1930s, who also had a photo studio in the same building in the second half of the 1930s. The negatives have been kept in the manufacturer's boxes, partly divided thematically. The notebooks in the boxes indicate that V.Vende has made contact copies of many of them.
The transferor Rita Hillermaa is the daughter of Valdeko Vende.
Content of the collection: Tallinn buildings and city views, Estonian orchestras and artists, athletes, action photography, nature views, photomontages, photography of works of art. Date: 1920s-1930s. 2 are flat film negatives, the rest are glass negatives. The negatives were photographed around 1925-1939. 100 negatives are of interest to the museum in terms of content. Among the remaining 184, there are unidentified landscape views, unsuccessful (foggy) architectural photography, action photography with the same person, many reproductions of photos, paintings, drawings, posters, sculptures with different content. However, primary is the collection value, as individual negatives may contain clues as to the original origin of the rest of the negatives. Transferred by: Rita Hillermaa.

The (partial) collection of glass negatives that belonged to the heritage of home researcher and photo collector Valdeko Vende probably originally came from the premises of Suur-Karja 9 in Tallinn. Many glass negatives can be identified as being photographed by Alendander Teppor in the 1920s-1930s, who also had a photo studio in the same building in the second half of the 1930s. The negatives have been kept in the manufacturer's boxes, partly divided thematically. The notebooks in the boxes indicate that V.Vende has made contact copies of many of them.
The transferor Rita Hillermaa is the daughter of Valdeko Vende.
Content of the collection: Tallinn buildings and city views, Estonian orchestras and artists, athletes, action photography, nature views, photomontages, photography of works of art. Date: 1920s-1930s. 2 are flat film negatives, the rest are glass negatives. The negatives were photographed around 1925-1939. 100 negatives are of interest to the museum in terms of content. Among the remaining 184, there are unidentified landscape views, unsuccessful (foggy) architectural photography, action photography with the same person, many reproductions of photos, paintings, drawings, posters, sculptures with different content. However, primary is the collection value, as individual negatives may contain clues as to the original origin of the rest of the negatives. Transferred by: Rita Hillermaa. From Valdeko Vende's legacy. Remnants of black paper on the edges of the emulsion.",photo negative

3389580,"Documents, photos and biography of Artur Oksenberg (1895 Vastemõisa parish-1976 Kuivajõe k/n).
He was the owner of three properties in Tallinn during the first republic (store Ararat 1930-1940, house Köleri 22 and cottage Kloogal (later holiday home of the Estonia Theater)).
Arrested on 14.06.41, got ten years. In Siberia, he was saved from being shot the first time by his ability to make bread (he worked as a miller) and the second time by his ability to make skis. Released from the camp on 09.05.51. He was rehabilitated, went to live in the village of Liiva in the municipality of Kose, with Alma Johanson, the husband of his shop employee Theodor. Theodor had died, Alma became his life partner and was a construction foreman in the collective farm. Alma Johanson was the donor's husband's aunt who bequeathed her farm to the donor's husband. The donated materials come from this farm.
At the age of 13, Artur went to Tallinn as an apprentice in Jaan Stern's locksmith workshop. He studied there for three years and went to elementary school in the evenings. After that, he worked at the Rotermann factory as a machine repairman for grist and flour mills. Since then, his work lanterns have been preserved at the gates of the Rotermann factory until now. From there he went to the department of locomotives and class cars in Tallinn as a locksmith, from where after some time he was appointed as a specialist in the Russian-Baltic shipyard ""Bekker"" for his good work.

Later, he was a member of the Vaps and was a candidate for the mayor of Tallinn, exiled to Kihnu Island.
His uncle Jüri Oksenberg (1876-1954) participated in the War of Independence, was a defense ally and Rakvere city councilor, council member, National Assembly member, Viru bank board member and owned a shop. His daughter Grunhild (b. 1919) wrote a family history at school, for which she received three grades and which has been preserved thanks to Artur's rewriting. Entered the Faculty of Medicine in Tartu (1938), emigrated to Sweden in 1943.  ",photo

3211384,"Glass negative   The author of the glass negatives is Hugo Raud (born 1894 Vana-Vigala), father of the transferor. The glass negatives have the watchmaker's workshop of the grandfather of the transferor, Kristjan Raud (1864 Vinni, Viru-Jaagupi - November 7, 1935).
Grandfather was a cook in the Vigala manor and a servant to his wife. Around 1904, he ran a teahouse in Märjamaa. Either immediately after 1905 or later, the family moved to Tallinn, and the father had a watchmaker's workshop near Tartu mnt. When the Republic of Estonia was established, the family moved to Petseri, due to the health condition of the grandmother.
The negatives probably also have family pictures of Petser and interior views of the Mayer chemical factory in Tallinn, where Hugo Raud himself worked. Negative in half",photo negative

The 1/3 portrait of the Estonian dancer Ella Ilbaku (1895 – 1997), who performed mainly in Western European countries, emphasizes her fragility as a dancer and her slightly melancholic mood, which is best summed up by the title of Ilbaku's memoir, published in 1953, ""Otsekui hirv kisendab"". In the painting, the artist has mainly used warm orange tones and the harmonizing moss green, which create a complete overall impression. The hand painted in an academic style gives Ilbak an almost divine appearance. /text Liisi Aibel, 2013/  ",country

The (partial) collection of glass negatives that belonged to the heritage of home researcher and photo collector Valdeko Vende probably originally came from the premises of Suur-Karja 9 in Tallinn. Many glass negatives can be identified as being photographed by Alendander Teppor in the 1920s-1930s, who also had a photo studio in the same building in the second half of the 1930s. The negatives have been kept in the manufacturer's boxes, partly divided thematically. The notebooks in the boxes indicate that V.Vende has made contact copies of many of them.
The transferor Rita Hillermaa is the daughter of Valdeko Vende.
Content of the collection: Tallinn buildings and city views, Estonian orchestras and artists, athletes, action photography, nature views, photomontages, photography of works of art. Date: 1920s-1930s. 2 are flat film negatives, the rest are glass negatives. The negatives were photographed around 1925-1939. 100 negatives are of interest to the museum in terms of content. Among the remaining 184, there are unidentified landscape views, unsuccessful (foggy) architectural photography, action photography with the same person, many reproductions of photos, paintings, drawings, posters, sculptures with different content. However, primary is the collection value, as individual negatives may contain clues as to the original origin of the rest of the negatives. Transferred by: Rita Hillermaa. From Valdeko Vende's legacy.  ",photo negative

2848941,"Interior view of A. M. Luther factory - production equipment   The photos come from the collections of the A. M. Luther factory (later TVMK) museum. In 2004, the company Ars Projekt OÜ signed an agreement with representatives of TVMK (Tallinn Vineeri- ja Möblikombinaat) to redesign the factory complex into a residential quarter. By that time, the historical factory was in a dilapidated state, the exhibits of the factory museum were neglected and scattered, in addition to this, the museum premises were said to have been flooded. The transferred materials also come from there. The transferor noticed the photos while exploring the premises of the factory and asked the customer's representative to use them to get to know the past of the historic building complex as thoroughly as possible. Since the customer had no interest and desire to preserve or exhibit the photos himself, the transferor considered it right to hand them over to the Architecture Museum (2008) after being used in the design. Anne Lass, chief treasurer of the Museum of Architecture, handed over the photos to the Estonian History Museum in October 2014 on the grounds that the material does not meet the collection principles of the Museum of Architecture.

The collection consists of album fragments (photos are pasted on cardboard sheets) and individual photos gathered in three envelopes. The collection is bound together between quick binding covers.
The photos show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s. The four oldest photos show the construction of the factory's new buildings in 1912. The most recent photos are from 1965 (4 pieces), which depict the events of the factory collective. A collection of album excerpts from the museum of the former Tallinn Vineeri- and Mööblikombinaat, bound in a swing binder. Contains 323 photos pasted on album pages from probably 7 different albums. The pictures show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s.

 From June 1, 2010, the name of Reval Hotel Olümpia changed to Radisson Blu Olümpia, and the new name of Reval Central became Park Inn Central Tallinn.
According to Margo Lorvi, board member of the Reval Hotel Group, which manages Reval hotels, the name change took place because the owner of the hotels, Norwegian Linstow, gave the right to operate 10 hotels to the Rezidor hotel group. As a result, six hotels currently bearing the Reval brand became Radisson Blu and four hotels became Park Inns. The change only means a change of operator, Linstow will still be the owner of the accommodation facilities. In Tallinn, it affected two hotels, Olümpia and Hotel Central on Narva road, respectively.

A 3/4 portrait of the legendary Estonian actor Ants Eskola (1908 – 1989), on which the main attention is drawn by the face covered with a dense geometric network and elaborated with the subtle psychology of the Roode. When depicting the figure, the artist has used vigorous brushstrokes, but lacks the deconstruction that is often characteristic of him, which makes the figure extremely realistic. The greenish-brown and gray tones used for the figure form a slightly strange contrast with the light pastel tones used in the background of the painting, but at the same time this contrast helps highlight the most important thing - Eskola's face. /text Liisi Aibel, 2013/  ",country

To have come here with this advice to take the exam at the conservatory for the diploma. We'll see if it holds up. It is not understood why he would say that again - he wants to take the exam before his death, doesn't he need another one without a diploma?
Do the bad exams and pass the good ones, then I'll bring you a nice shoe.

The (partial) collection of glass negatives that belonged to the heritage of home researcher and photo collector Valdeko Vende probably originally came from the premises of Suur-Karja 9 in Tallinn. Many glass negatives can be identified as being photographed by Alendander Teppor in the 1920s-1930s, who also had a photo studio in the same building in the second half of the 1930s. The negatives have been kept in the manufacturer's boxes, partly divided thematically. The notebooks in the boxes indicate that V.Vende has made contact copies of many of them.
The transferor Rita Hillermaa is the daughter of Valdeko Vende.
Content of the collection: Tallinn buildings and city views, Estonian orchestras and artists, athletes, action photography, nature views, photomontages, photography of works of art. Date: 1920s-1930s. 2 are flat film negatives, the rest are glass negatives. The negatives were photographed around 1925-1939. 100 negatives are of interest to the museum in terms of content. Among the remaining 184, there are unidentified landscape views, unsuccessful (foggy) architectural photography, action photography with the same person, many reproductions of photos, paintings, drawings, posters, sculptures with different content. However, primary is the collection value, as individual negatives may contain clues as to the original origin of the rest of the negatives. Transferred by: Rita Hillermaa.

2849007,"Photo on the album page   The photos come from the collections of the A. M. Luther factory (later TVMK) museum. In 2004, the company Ars Projekt OÜ signed an agreement with representatives of TVMK (Tallinn Vineeri- ja Möblikombinaat) to redesign the factory complex into a residential quarter. By that time, the historical factory was in a dilapidated state, the exhibits of the factory museum were neglected and scattered, in addition to this, the museum premises were said to have been flooded. The transferred materials also come from there. The transferor noticed the photos while exploring the premises of the factory and asked the customer's representative to use them to get to know the past of the historic building complex as thoroughly as possible. Since the customer had no interest and desire to preserve or exhibit the photos himself, the transferor considered it right to hand them over to the Architecture Museum (2008) after being used in the design. Anne Lass, chief treasurer of the Museum of Architecture, handed over the photos to the Estonian History Museum in October 2014 on the grounds that the material does not meet the collection principles of the Museum of Architecture.

The collection consists of album fragments (photos are pasted on cardboard sheets) and individual photos gathered in three envelopes. The collection is bound together between quick binding covers.
The photos show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s. The four oldest photos show the construction of the factory's new buildings in 1912. The most recent photos are from 1965 (4 pieces), which depict the events of the factory collective. A collection of album excerpts from the museum of the former Tallinn Vineeri- and Mööblikombinaat, bound in a swing binder. Contains 323 photos pasted on album pages from probably 7 different albums. The pictures show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s.

Grandfather was a cook in the Vigala manor and a servant to his wife. Around 1904, he ran a teahouse in Märjamaa. Either immediately after 1905 or later, the family moved to Tallinn, and the father had a watchmaker's workshop near Tartu mnt. When the Republic of Estonia was established, the family moved to Petseri, due to the health condition of the grandmother.
The negatives probably also have family pictures of Petser and interior views of the Mayer chemical factory in Tallinn, where Hugo Raud himself worked.  ",photo negative

Million dollar gift to the history museum
Ivar Leimus

A few weeks ago, the employees of the Estonian History Museum dragged several exceptionally heavy suitcases, full of old Estonian money and official and merit badges, from the ship in Stockholm to the Tallinn quay. The event was both happy and sad. I was happy because the museum's collections were replenished to a very significant extent. For example, among the received paper money, there is an almost complete series of the first provisional means of payment of independent Estonia - 5% debt obligations of the Republic and bills of the State Treasury - a collection that cannot be put aside. Blue Crosses of Liberty, Eagle, White Star and Red Cross stars shine among the decorations, several unique military unit insignias, etc. are represented. A beautiful systematic collection of coins that have circulated in Estonia throughout history cannot be left out, among which the rare 9th-century dirhem of the Khazar state, the water ring minted in Riga during the time of Master of the Order Wolter von Plettenberg, the 1702 half ruble of Tsar Peter the Great, etc. attract attention at first glance.
It goes without saying that this is (despite the economic recession) a valuable collection, the price of which, based on the expertise carried out in Sweden, reaches well over a million Estonian kroons. Such gifts are not given every day. Or rather (apart from the works of art), no museum in Estonia has ever received such a generous donation.
And here we come to the sad part of the event. The valuable collection came to the museum as a legacy. On May 7, 2008, the meritorious collector Taavi Triumph died in Stockholm. The boy from Haapsalu arrived in Sweden during the storm in the autumn of 1944, lost his father, got an education abroad and a job at the prestigious Handelsbanken. Merging into the safe everyday life of the Swedish state, he remained an Estonian until the end, was an active scout, edited the wolf leaders' magazine ""Hiietule Ümber"", participated in a singing choir, translated, wrote journalism and, above all, collected and researched. Published by Taavi Triuphi in 1970-1980. years in the magazine ""Eesti Filatelist"" a series of meaningful and voluminous articles about Estonian money and decorations, his related exhibitions were always popular among Estonians in Sweden. As a long-term member of the Swedish Numismatic Society, he was awarded the society's gold merit pin last year to mark 40 years of activity. However, Taavi Triumph received the highest recognition, the White Star medal, in his home country, whose banking he helped to build.
Having known Taavit for almost the last twenty years, I know that collecting was not just a hobby for him, but his biggest passion, at least in that period of his life. And it deserves deep respect that at a time when some of our precious collections are being tried to make money in a hurry, a man who loved Estonia from the bottom of his heart decided to leave his most precious property to his homeland. The general public will be able to see pearls from the Taavi Triumph collection at a special exhibition at the history museum next year.

2848965,"Interior view of the A. M. Luther factory - production equipment   The photos come from the collections of the A. M. Luther factory (later TVMK) museum. In 2004, the company Ars Projekt OÜ signed an agreement with representatives of TVMK (Tallinn Vineeri- ja Möblikombinaat) to redesign the factory complex into a residential quarter. By that time, the historical factory was in a dilapidated state, the exhibits of the factory museum were neglected and scattered, in addition to this, the museum premises were said to have been flooded. The transferred materials also come from there. The transferor noticed the photos while exploring the premises of the factory and asked the customer's representative to use them to get to know the past of the historic building complex as thoroughly as possible. Since the customer had no interest and desire to preserve or exhibit the photos himself, the transferor considered it right to hand them over to the Architecture Museum (2008) after being used in the design. Anne Lass, chief treasurer of the Museum of Architecture, handed over the photos to the Estonian History Museum in October 2014 on the grounds that the material does not meet the collection principles of the Museum of Architecture.

The collection consists of album fragments (photos are pasted on cardboard sheets) and individual photos gathered in three envelopes. The collection is bound together between quick binding covers.
The photos show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s. The four oldest photos show the construction of the factory's new buildings in 1912. The most recent photos are from 1965 (4 pieces), which depict the events of the factory collective. A collection of album excerpts from the museum of the former Tallinn Vineeri- and Mööblikombinaat, bound in a swing binder. Contains 323 photos pasted on album pages from probably 7 different albums. The pictures show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s.

She made them when she was about 9-10 years old, when she could already knit and do needlework. He made the books later, in 1948. The dolls also once had a home with cardboard furniture, which unfortunately has been destroyed today.
H. Kendra was an ordinary child who grew up with her mother during the war. His father died in 1944. Hiie's mother was an accountant and Hiie himself studied to be an accountant. All his life, however, H. Kender worked as a tram driver. She continued to do beautiful needlework throughout her life. In addition, he read a lot (also in English), and his friends also remember him as an actor in the folk theater and an active lover of gardening and travel.

Grandfather was a cook in the Vigala manor and a servant to his wife. Around 1904, he ran a teahouse in Märjamaa. Either immediately after 1905 or later, the family moved to Tallinn, and the father had a watchmaker's workshop near Tartu mnt. When the Republic of Estonia was established, the family moved to Petseri, due to the health condition of the grandmother.
The negatives probably also have family pictures of Petser and interior views of the Mayer chemical factory in Tallinn, where Hugo Raud himself worked.  ",photo negative

Grandfather was a cook in the Vigala manor and a servant to his wife. Around 1904, he ran a teahouse in Märjamaa.

The 3/4 portrait of Estonian playwright and theater and literary critic Hugo Raudsepp (1883 – 1952) shows him reading a manuscript. It is possible that Väli was inspired to paint the portrait by the presentation of some of Raudsepa's plays (in 1946, the writer published two plays - ""Rats"" and ""Tagatipu Tiisenoosen""). The style of the portrait is realistic. The playwright is depicted as an older, lean gentleman, engrossed in reading a manuscript. A vase of spring flowers is placed on the table behind him, and the general atmosphere seems friendly and holy. /text Liisi Aibel, 2013/  ",country

In 2004, the company Ars Projekt OÜ signed an agreement with representatives of TVMK (Tallinn Vineeri- ja Möblikombinaat) to redesign the factory complex into a residential quarter. By that time, the historical factory was in a dilapidated state, the exhibits of the factory museum were neglected and scattered, in addition to this, the museum premises were said to have been flooded. The transferred materials also come from there. The transferor noticed the photos while exploring the premises of the factory and asked the customer's representative to use them to get to know the past of the historic building complex as thoroughly as possible. Since the customer had no interest and desire to preserve or exhibit the photos himself, the transferor considered it right to hand them over to the Architecture Museum (2008) after being used in the design. Anne Lass, chief treasurer of the Museum of Architecture, handed over the photos to the Estonian History Museum in October 2014 on the grounds that the material does not meet the collection principles of the Museum of Architecture.

The collection consists of album fragments (photos are pasted on cardboard sheets) and individual photos gathered in three envelopes. The collection is bound together between quick binding covers.
The photos show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s. The four oldest photos show the construction of the factory's new buildings in 1912. The most recent photos are from 1965 (4 pieces), which depict the events of the factory collective. A collection of album excerpts from the museum of the former Tallinn Vineeri- and Mööblikombinaat, bound in a swing binder. Contains 323 photos pasted on album pages from probably 7 different albums. The pictures show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s.

The (partial) collection of glass negatives that belonged to the heritage of home researcher and photo collector Valdeko Vende probably originally came from the premises of Suur-Karja 9 in Tallinn. Many glass negatives can be identified as being photographed by Alendander Teppor in the 1920s-1930s, who also had a photo studio in the same building in the second half of the 1930s. The negatives have been kept in the manufacturer's boxes, partly divided thematically. The notebooks in the boxes indicate that V.Vende has made contact copies of many of them.
The transferor Rita Hillermaa is the daughter of Valdeko Vende.
Content of the collection: Tallinn buildings and city views, Estonian orchestras and artists, athletes, action photography, nature views, photomontages, photography of works of art. Date: 1920s-1930s. 2 are flat film negatives, the rest are glass negatives. The negatives were photographed around 1925-1939. 100 negatives are of interest to the museum in terms of content. Among the remaining 184, there are unidentified landscape views, unsuccessful (foggy) architectural photography, action photography with the same person, many reproductions of photos, paintings, drawings, posters, sculptures with different content. However, primary is the collection value, as individual negatives may contain clues as to the original origin of the rest of the negatives. Transferred by: Rita Hillermaa.

3486559,"Table sign: Finland   Souvenirs and gifts
The selection of souvenirs and gifts of the presidency was based on the identity of the presidency, which in turn came down to three overarching themes:
- Estonia as a digital country
- Estonian design
- Estonian food
In addition, practical and/or protocol restrictions were taken into account when choosing souvenirs and gifts:
- The gift with packaging must fit in hand luggage
- Gifts containing liquids can cause problems in air transport
- Giving away alcohol is not a good tone
- Glass, ceramics can break, leather can be culturally inappropriate
- Gifts could be gender neutral (except for ministers)
- Gifts could be practical
The concept of gifts was developed centrally by the State Chancellery, and all procurements were also carried out by the State Chancellery. Ministries could make their preferences from the selection of gifts/souvenirs proposed by the State Chancellery. Gifts with a distinctive solution were created for the guests of the parliamentary presidency of the Riigikogu. The selection of gifts was primarily based on the recipients of the gifts and their position. no. 12 Table signs and sign bases of countries and institutions. Radisson Blue, Radisson Olümpia, Nordic Hotel Forum, Swissotel and Hilton hotels in Tallinn were centrally equipped with background solutions throughout the presidency.

2080008,"Studio photo: circus performer.  glass negative. The (partial) collection of glass negatives that belonged to the heritage of home researcher and photo collector Valdeko Vende probably originally came from the premises of Suur-Karja 9 in Tallinn. Many glass negatives can be identified as being photographed by Alendander Teppor in the 1920s-1930s, who also had a photo studio in the same building in the second half of the 1930s. The negatives have been kept in the manufacturer's boxes, partly divided thematically. The notebooks in the boxes indicate that V.Vende has made contact copies of many of them.
The transferor Rita Hillermaa is the daughter of Valdeko Vende.
Content of the collection: Tallinn buildings and city views, Estonian orchestras and artists, athletes, action photography, nature views, photomontages, photography of works of art. Date: 1920s-1930s. 2 are flat film negatives, the rest are glass negatives. The negatives were photographed around 1925-1939. 100 negatives are of interest to the museum in terms of content. Among the remaining 184, there are unidentified landscape views, unsuccessful (foggy) architectural photography, action photography with the same person, many reproductions of photos, paintings, drawings, posters, sculptures with different content. However, primary is the collection value, as individual negatives may contain clues as to the original origin of the rest of the negatives. Rita Hillermaa. From Valdeko Vende's legacy.

Grandfather was a cook in the Vigala manor and a servant to his wife. Around 1904, he ran a teahouse in Märjamaa. Either immediately after 1905 or later, the family moved to Tallinn, and the father had a watchmaker's workshop near Tartu mnt. When the Republic of Estonia was established, the family moved to Petseri, due to the health condition of the grandmother.
The negatives probably also have family pictures of Petser and interior views of the Mayer chemical factory in Tallinn, where Hugo Raud himself worked.  ",photo negative

Million dollar gift to the history museum
Ivar Leimus

A few weeks ago, the employees of the Estonian History Museum dragged several exceptionally heavy suitcases, full of old Estonian money and official and merit badges, from the ship in Stockholm to the Tallinn quay. The event was both happy and sad. I was happy because the museum's collections were replenished to a very significant extent. For example, among the received paper money, there is an almost complete series of the first provisional means of payment of independent Estonia - 5% debt obligations of the Republic and bills of the State Treasury - a collection that cannot be put aside. Blue Crosses of Liberty, Eagle, White Star and Red Cross stars shine among the decorations, several unique military unit insignias, etc. are represented. A beautiful systematic collection of coins that have circulated in Estonia throughout history cannot be left out, among which the rare 9th-century dirhem of the Khazar state, the water ring minted in Riga during the time of Master of the Order Wolter von Plettenberg, the 1702 half ruble of Tsar Peter the Great, etc. attract attention at first glance.
It goes without saying that this is (despite the economic recession) a valuable collection, the price of which, based on the expertise carried out in Sweden, reaches well over a million Estonian kroons. Such gifts are not given every day. Or rather (apart from the works of art), no museum in Estonia has ever received such a generous donation.
And here we come to the sad part of the event. The valuable collection came to the museum as a legacy. On May 7, 2008, the meritorious collector Taavi Triumph died in Stockholm. The boy from Haapsalu arrived in Sweden during the storm in the autumn of 1944, lost his father, got an education abroad and a job at the prestigious Handelsbanken. Merging into the safe everyday life of the Swedish state, he remained an Estonian until the end, was an active scout, edited the wolf leaders' magazine ""Hiietule Ümber"", participated in a singing choir, translated, wrote journalism and, above all, collected and researched. Published by Taavi Triuphi in 1970-1980. years in the magazine ""Eesti Filatelist"" a series of meaningful and voluminous articles about Estonian money and decorations, his related exhibitions were always popular among Estonians in Sweden. As a long-term member of the Swedish Numismatic Society, he was awarded the society's gold merit pin last year to mark 40 years of activity. However, Taavi Triumph received the highest recognition, the White Star medal, in his home country, whose banking he helped to build.
Having known Taavit for almost the last twenty years, I know that collecting was not just a hobby for him, but his biggest passion, at least in that period of his life. And it deserves deep respect that at a time when some of our precious collections are being tried to make money in a hurry, a man who loved Estonia from the bottom of his heart decided to leave his most precious property to his homeland. The general public will be able to see pearls from the Taavi Triumph collection at a special exhibition at the history museum next year.

The (partial) collection of glass negatives that belonged to the heritage of home researcher and photo collector Valdeko Vende probably originally came from the premises of Suur-Karja 9 in Tallinn. Many glass negatives can be identified as being photographed by Alendander Teppor in the 1920s-1930s, who also had a photo studio in the same building in the second half of the 1930s. The negatives have been kept in the manufacturer's boxes, partly divided thematically. The notebooks in the boxes indicate that V.Vende has made contact copies of many of them.
The transferor Rita Hillermaa is the daughter of Valdeko Vende.
Content of the collection: Tallinn buildings and city views, Estonian orchestras and artists, athletes, action photography, nature views, photomontages, photography of works of art. Date: 1920s-1930s. 2 are flat film negatives, the rest are glass negatives. The negatives were photographed around 1925-1939. 100 negatives are of interest to the museum in terms of content. Among the remaining 184, there are unidentified landscape views, unsuccessful (foggy) architectural photography, action photography with the same person, many reproductions of photos, paintings, drawings, posters, sculptures with different content. However, primary is the collection value, as individual negatives may contain clues as to the original origin of the rest of the negatives. Transferred by: Rita Hillermaa.

Biographical data:
Born on June 3, 1910 in Narva, where his father Gustav Birgi had a lemonade factory.
He started studying at the I Estonian primary school in the city of Narva. In the spring of 1923, the family (father, mother Miili (née Taska), younger sister Armilda (later Aade, married colonel Jakob Vende in 1938) and older half-brother Valter) moved to Elva. He graduated from the 7th grade of the upper primary school in Elva town in 1925, after which he moved to his uncle Eduard Taska's leather art studio to learn the trade. He worked there as a student in the educational workshop from 15.07.1925 to 27.09.1928, then he became a skilled worker in the field of book binding, hand gilding and artistic leather work. At the beginning of 1929, the office of materials storekeeper was added. At the beginning of 1937, he became assistant foreman. On June 12, 1937, he received a master's professional certificate in the field of bookbinding from the Tallinn Labor Skills Board, and at the beginning of 1938, he also took the position of master in Taska's studio.
SCOUTING ACTIVITIES already started in Elvas. In 1930 at the latest, he was a junior scoutmaster, and in March 1933 at the latest, the assistant leader of the Tallinn Scouts Maleva (the leader was a good friend of the skm Richard Treu (later represented: Tõnuri).
In 1933 he was promoted to Scoutmaster. In 1939, as a Scoutmaster, he received the Order of the Estonian Red Cross II class from the President of the Republic. medal.
In addition to work and his keen scouting hobby, he was also very versatile in other ways: on his free evenings, he bound his excellent library of nearly 400 volumes, made beautiful albums and leather goods for himself and as gifts; belonged to various associations, e.g. Private Library Owners' Association, Estonian-Czechoslovakian Association, etc., 1934 studied (or taught?) in an Esperanto course. In the summer of 1941, Viktor Birk was mobilized into the Red Army and taken to the Molotov (Perm) region, where he started working as a chef and later as a dining hall manager in a local ""trust"", as he calls it in his only surviving letter dated April 18, 1943. It was expected that the last Estonians left there would also be called to Teljabinsk - some to the division, some to work in their profession. But then all contact with him disappeared. Many years later, it was found out through the Red Cross that he had been arrested for some reason and died somewhere in a detention center in the Molotov region at the age of 34 on May 30, 1944. The death certificate obtained from Perm in 1957 states the standard ""failure of the heart"" as the cause of death.

The (partial) collection of glass negatives that belonged to the heritage of home researcher and photo collector Valdeko Vende probably originally came from the premises of Suur-Karja 9 in Tallinn. Many glass negatives can be identified as being photographed by Alendander Teppor in the 1920s-1930s, who also had a photo studio in the same building in the second half of the 1930s. The negatives have been kept in the manufacturer's boxes, partly divided thematically. The notebooks in the boxes indicate that V.Vende has made contact copies of many of them.
The transferor Rita Hillermaa is the daughter of Valdeko Vende.
Content of the collection: Tallinn buildings and city views, Estonian orchestras and artists, athletes, action photography, nature views, photomontages, photography of works of art. Date: 1920s-1930s. 2 are flat film negatives, the rest are glass negatives. The negatives were photographed around 1925-1939. 100 negatives are of interest to the museum in terms of content. Among the remaining 184, there are unidentified landscape views, unsuccessful (foggy) architectural photography, action photography with the same person, many reproductions of photos, paintings, drawings, posters, sculptures with different content. However, primary is the collection value, as individual negatives may contain clues as to the original origin of the rest of the negatives. Transferred by: Rita Hillermaa.

2849120,"A. M. Luther factory raw material - logs in water   The photos come from the collections of the A. M. Luther factory (later TVMK) museum. In 2004, the company Ars Projekt OÜ signed an agreement with representatives of TVMK (Tallinn Vineeri- ja Möblikombinaat) to redesign the factory complex into a residential quarter. By that time, the historical factory was in a dilapidated state, the exhibits of the factory museum were neglected and scattered, in addition to this, the museum premises were said to have been flooded. The transferred materials also come from there. The transferor noticed the photos while exploring the premises of the factory and asked the customer's representative to use them to get to know the past of the historic building complex as thoroughly as possible. Since the customer had no interest and desire to preserve or exhibit the photos himself, the transferor considered it right to hand them over to the Architecture Museum (2008) after being used in the design. Anne Lass, chief treasurer of the Museum of Architecture, handed over the photos to the Estonian History Museum in October 2014 on the grounds that the material does not meet the collection principles of the Museum of Architecture.

The collection consists of album fragments (photos are pasted on cardboard sheets) and individual photos gathered in three envelopes. The collection is bound together between quick binding covers.
The photos show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s. The four oldest photos show the construction of the factory's new buildings in 1912. The most recent photos are from 1965 (4 pieces), which depict the events of the factory collective. The photos show the transportation of raw material from the A. M. Luther factory and the so-called Luther's pool in the Tallinn Mine Harbor in the 1920s. The photos are initially gathered in one envelope. on the front, in the middle, a stain from paper fibers stuck to the emulsion; slight soiling on the back, many photos have severe moisture damage (the photo emulsion is partially detached).",photo

The (partial) collection of glass negatives that belonged to the heritage of home researcher and photo collector Valdeko Vende probably originally came from the premises of Suur-Karja 9 in Tallinn. Many glass negatives can be identified as being photographed by Alendander Teppor in the 1920s-1930s, who also had a photo studio in the same building in the second half of the 1930s. The negatives have been kept in the manufacturer's boxes, partly divided thematically. The notebooks in the boxes indicate that V.Vende has made contact copies of many of them.
The transferor Rita Hillermaa is the daughter of Valdeko Vende.
Content of the collection: Tallinn buildings and city views, Estonian orchestras and artists, athletes, action photography, nature views, photomontages, photography of works of art. Date: 1920s-1930s. 2 are flat film negatives, the rest are glass negatives. The negatives were photographed around 1925-1939. 100 negatives are of interest to the museum in terms of content. Among the remaining 184, there are unidentified landscape views, unsuccessful (foggy) architectural photography, action photography with the same person, many reproductions of photos, paintings, drawings, posters, sculptures with different content. However, primary is the collection value, as individual negatives may contain clues as to the original origin of the rest of the negatives. Transferred by: Rita Hillermaa.

In the winter of 1939/40, Ellen stayed with the consul's family in Holland and stayed there because of the war.
The album was handed over to the museum by Ilmar van der Heij, son of Ellen Hals. The photos were taken by Consul Arie van der Bosch. Since it was not possible to get in touch with the transferor to sign the deed, the museum's research director Krista Sarv will hand over the items.  ",photo

2849067,"Photo on the album page   The photos come from the collections of the A. M. Luther factory (later TVMK) museum. In 2004, the company Ars Projekt OÜ signed an agreement with representatives of TVMK (Tallinn Vineeri- ja Möblikombinaat) to redesign the factory complex into a residential quarter. By that time, the historical factory was in a dilapidated state, the exhibits of the factory museum were neglected and scattered, in addition to this, the museum premises were said to have been flooded. The transferred materials also come from there. The transferor noticed the photos while exploring the premises of the factory and asked the customer's representative to use them to get to know the past of the historic building complex as thoroughly as possible. Since the customer had no interest and desire to preserve or exhibit the photos himself, the transferor considered it right to hand them over to the Architecture Museum (2008) after being used in the design. Anne Lass, chief treasurer of the Museum of Architecture, handed over the photos to the Estonian History Museum in October 2014 on the grounds that the material does not meet the collection principles of the Museum of Architecture.

The collection consists of album fragments (photos are pasted on cardboard sheets) and individual photos gathered in three envelopes. The collection is bound together between quick binding covers.
The photos show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s. The four oldest photos show the construction of the factory's new buildings in 1912. The most recent photos are from 1965 (4 pieces), which depict the events of the factory collective. A collection of album excerpts from the museum of the former Tallinn Vineeri- and Mööblikombinaat, bound in a swing binder. Contains 323 photos pasted on album pages from probably 7 different albums. The pictures show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s.

The (partial) collection of glass negatives that belonged to the heritage of home researcher and photo collector Valdeko Vende probably originally came from the premises of Suur-Karja 9 in Tallinn. Many glass negatives can be identified as being photographed by Alendander Teppor in the 1920s-1930s, who also had a photo studio in the same building in the second half of the 1930s. The negatives have been kept in the manufacturer's boxes, partly divided thematically. The notebooks in the boxes indicate that V.Vende has made contact copies of many of them.
The transferor Rita Hillermaa is the daughter of Valdeko Vende.
Content of the collection: Tallinn buildings and city views, Estonian orchestras and artists, athletes, action photography, nature views, photomontages, photography of works of art. Date: 1920s-1930s. 2 are flat film negatives, the rest are glass negatives. The negatives were photographed around 1925-1939. 100 negatives are of interest to the museum in terms of content. Among the remaining 184, there are unidentified landscape views, unsuccessful (foggy) architectural photography, action photography with the same person, many reproductions of photos, paintings, drawings, posters, sculptures with different content. However, primary is the collection value, as individual negatives may contain clues as to the original origin of the rest of the negatives. Transferred by: Rita Hillermaa.

Million dollar gift to the history museum
Ivar Leimus

A few weeks ago, the employees of the Estonian History Museum dragged several exceptionally heavy suitcases, full of old Estonian money and official and merit badges, from the ship in Stockholm to the Tallinn quay. The event was both happy and sad. I was happy because the museum's collections were replenished to a very significant extent. For example, among the received paper money, there is an almost complete series of the first provisional means of payment of independent Estonia - 5% debt obligations of the Republic and bills of the State Treasury - a collection that cannot be put aside. Blue Crosses of Liberty, Eagle, White Star and Red Cross stars shine among the decorations, several unique military unit insignias, etc. are represented. A beautiful systematic collection of coins that have circulated in Estonia throughout history cannot be left out, among which the rare 9th-century dirhem of the Khazar state, the water ring minted in Riga during the time of Master of the Order Wolter von Plettenberg, the 1702 half ruble of Tsar Peter the Great, etc. attract attention at first glance.
It goes without saying that this is (despite the economic recession) a valuable collection, the price of which, based on the expertise carried out in Sweden, reaches well over a million Estonian kroons. Such gifts are not given every day. Or rather (apart from the works of art), no museum in Estonia has ever received such a generous donation.
And here we come to the sad part of the event. The valuable collection came to the museum as a legacy. On May 7, 2008, the meritorious collector Taavi Triumph died in Stockholm. The boy from Haapsalu arrived in Sweden during the storm in the autumn of 1944, lost his father, got an education abroad and a job at the prestigious Handelsbanken. Merging into the safe everyday life of the Swedish state, he remained an Estonian until the end, was an active scout, edited the wolf leaders' magazine ""Hiietule Ümber"", participated in a singing choir, translated, wrote journalism and, above all, collected and researched. Published by Taavi Triuphi in 1970-1980. years in the magazine ""Eesti Filatelist"" a series of meaningful and voluminous articles about Estonian money and decorations, his related exhibitions were always popular among Estonians in Sweden. As a long-term member of the Swedish Numismatic Society, he was awarded the society's gold merit pin last year to mark 40 years of activity. However, Taavi Triumph received the highest recognition, the White Star medal, in his home country, whose banking he helped to build.
Having known Taavit for almost the last twenty years, I know that collecting was not just a hobby for him, but his biggest passion, at least in that period of his life. And it deserves deep respect that at a time when some of our precious collections are being tried to make money in a hurry, a man who loved Estonia from the bottom of his heart decided to leave his most precious property to his homeland. The general public will be able to see pearls from the Taavi Triumph collection at a special exhibition at the history museum next year.

In 2004, the company Ars Projekt OÜ signed an agreement with representatives of TVMK (Tallinn Vineeri- ja Möblikombinaat) to redesign the factory complex into a residential quarter. By that time, the historical factory was in a dilapidated state, the exhibits of the factory museum were neglected and scattered, in addition to this, the museum premises were said to have been flooded. The transferred materials also come from there. The transferor noticed the photos while exploring the premises of the factory and asked the customer's representative to use them to get to know the past of the historic building complex as thoroughly as possible. Since the customer had no interest and desire to preserve or exhibit the photos himself, the transferor considered it right to hand them over to the Architecture Museum (2008) after being used in the design. Anne Lass, chief treasurer of the Museum of Architecture, handed over the photos to the Estonian History Museum in October 2014 on the grounds that the material does not meet the collection principles of the Museum of Architecture.

The collection consists of album fragments (photos are pasted on cardboard sheets) and individual photos gathered in three envelopes. The collection is bound together between quick binding covers.
The photos show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s. The four oldest photos show the construction of the factory's new buildings in 1912. The most recent photos are from 1965 (4 pieces), which depict the events of the factory collective.

Grandfather was a cook in the Vigala manor and a servant to his wife. Around 1904, he ran a teahouse in Märjamaa. Either immediately after 1905 or later, the family moved to Tallinn, and the father had a watchmaker's workshop near Tartu mnt. When the Republic of Estonia was established, the family moved to Petseri, due to the health condition of the grandmother.

Million dollar gift to the history museum
Ivar Leimus

A few weeks ago, the employees of the Estonian History Museum dragged several exceptionally heavy suitcases, full of old Estonian money and official and merit badges, from the ship in Stockholm to the Tallinn quay. The event was both happy and sad. I was happy because the museum's collections were replenished to a very significant extent. For example, among the received paper money, there is an almost complete series of the first provisional means of payment of independent Estonia - 5% debt obligations of the Republic and bills of the State Treasury - a collection that cannot be put aside. Blue Crosses of Liberty, Eagle, White Star and Red Cross stars shine among the decorations, several unique military unit insignias, etc. are represented. A beautiful systematic collection of coins that have circulated in Estonia throughout history cannot be left out, among which the rare 9th-century dirhem of the Khazar state, the water ring minted in Riga during the time of Master of the Order Wolter von Plettenberg, the 1702 half ruble of Tsar Peter the Great, etc. attract attention at first glance.
It goes without saying that this is (despite the economic recession) a valuable collection, the price of which, based on the expertise carried out in Sweden, reaches well over a million Estonian kroons. Such gifts are not given every day. Or rather (apart from the works of art), no museum in Estonia has ever received such a generous donation.
And here we come to the sad part of the event. The valuable collection came to the museum as a legacy. On May 7, 2008, the meritorious collector Taavi Triumph died in Stockholm. The boy from Haapsalu arrived in Sweden during the storm in the autumn of 1944, lost his father, got an education abroad and a job at the prestigious Handelsbanken. Merging into the safe everyday life of the Swedish state, he remained an Estonian until the end, was an active scout, edited the wolf leaders' magazine ""Hiietule Ümber"", participated in a singing choir, translated, wrote journalism and, above all, collected and researched. Published by Taavi Triuphi in 1970-1980. years in the magazine ""Eesti Filatelist"" a series of meaningful and voluminous articles about Estonian money and decorations, his related exhibitions were always popular among Estonians in Sweden. As a long-term member of the Swedish Numismatic Society, he was awarded the society's gold merit pin last year to mark 40 years of activity. However, Taavi Triumph received the highest recognition, the White Star medal, in his home country, whose banking he helped to build.
Having known Taavit for almost the last twenty years, I know that collecting was not just a hobby for him, but his biggest passion, at least in that period of his life. And it deserves deep respect that at a time when some of our precious collections are being tried to make money in a hurry, a man who loved Estonia from the bottom of his heart decided to leave his most precious property to his homeland. The general public will be able to see pearls from the Taavi Triumph collection at a special exhibition at the history museum next year.

Grandfather was a cook in the Vigala manor and a servant to his wife. Around 1904, he ran a teahouse in Märjamaa.

In 2004, the company Ars Projekt OÜ signed an agreement with representatives of TVMK (Tallinn Vineeri- ja Möblikombinaat) to redesign the factory complex into a residential quarter. By that time, the historical factory was in a dilapidated state, the exhibits of the factory museum were neglected and scattered, in addition to this, the museum premises were said to have been flooded. The transferred materials also come from there. The transferor noticed the photos while exploring the premises of the factory and asked the customer's representative to use them to get to know the past of the historic building complex as thoroughly as possible. Since the customer had no interest and desire to preserve or exhibit the photos himself, the transferor considered it right to hand them over to the Architecture Museum (2008) after being used in the design. Anne Lass, chief treasurer of the Museum of Architecture, handed over the photos to the Estonian History Museum in October 2014 on the grounds that the material does not meet the collection principles of the Museum of Architecture.

The collection consists of album fragments (photos are pasted on cardboard sheets) and individual photos gathered in three envelopes. The collection is bound together between quick binding covers.
The photos show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s. The four oldest photos show the construction of the factory's new buildings in 1912. The most recent photos are from 1965 (4 pieces), which depict the events of the factory collective. A collection of album excerpts from the museum of the former Tallinn Vineeri- and Mööblikombinaat, bound in a swing binder. Contains 323 photos pasted on album pages from probably 7 different albums. The pictures show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s.

2080213,"Wooden sculpture - portrait of a man  glass negative. The (partial) collection of glass negatives that belonged to the heritage of home researcher and photo collector Valdeko Vende probably originally came from the premises of Suur-Karja 9 in Tallinn. Many glass negatives can be identified as being photographed by Alendander Teppor in the 1920s-1930s, who also had a photo studio in the same building in the second half of the 1930s. The negatives have been kept in the manufacturer's boxes, partly divided thematically. The notebooks in the boxes indicate that V.Vende has made contact copies of many of them.
The transferor Rita Hillermaa is the daughter of Valdeko Vende.
Content of the collection: Tallinn buildings and city views, Estonian orchestras and artists, athletes, action photography, nature views, photomontages, photography of works of art. Date: 1920s-1930s. 2 are flat film negatives, the rest are glass negatives. The negatives were photographed around 1925-1939. 100 negatives are of interest to the museum in terms of content. Among the remaining 184, there are unidentified landscape views, unsuccessful (foggy) architectural photography, action photography with the same person, many reproductions of photos, paintings, drawings, posters, sculptures with different content. However, primary is the collection value, as individual negatives may contain clues as to the original origin of the rest of the negatives. Transferred by: Rita Hillermaa. From Valdeko Vende's legacy.  ",photo negative

2079468,"Winter view across the Pärnu road to the New Market and the back of the Estonia Theatre.  glass negative. The (partial) collection of glass negatives that belonged to the heritage of home researcher and photo collector Valdeko Vende probably originally came from the premises of Suur-Karja 9 in Tallinn. Many glass negatives can be identified as being photographed by Alendander Teppor in the 1920s-1930s, who also had a photo studio in the same building in the second half of the 1930s. The negatives have been kept in the manufacturer's boxes, partly divided thematically. The notebooks in the boxes indicate that V.Vende has made contact copies of many of them.
The transferor Rita Hillermaa is the daughter of Valdeko Vende.
Content of the collection: Tallinn buildings and city views, Estonian orchestras and artists, athletes, action photography, nature views, photomontages, photography of works of art. Date: 1920s-1930s. 2 are flat film negatives, the rest are glass negatives. The negatives were photographed around 1925-1939. 100 negatives are of interest to the museum in terms of content. Among the remaining 184, there are unidentified landscape views, unsuccessful (foggy) architectural photography, action photography with the same person, many reproductions of photos, paintings, drawings, posters, sculptures with different content. However, primary is the collection value, as individual negatives may contain clues as to the original origin of the rest of the negatives. Transferred by: Rita Hillermaa. From Valdeko Vende's legacy. A strong silver mirror layer on the emulsion, paper scraps on the emulsion side.",photo negative

In 2004, the company Ars Projekt OÜ signed an agreement with representatives of TVMK (Tallinn Vineeri- ja Möblikombinaat) to redesign the factory complex into a residential quarter. By that time, the historical factory was in a dilapidated state, the exhibits of the factory museum were neglected and scattered, in addition to this, the museum premises were said to have been flooded.

Since the customer had no interest and desire to preserve or exhibit the photos himself, the transferor considered it right to hand them over to the Architecture Museum (2008) after being used in the design. Anne Lass, chief treasurer of the Museum of Architecture, handed over the photos to the Estonian History Museum in October 2014 on the grounds that the material does not meet the collection principles of the Museum of Architecture.

The collection consists of album fragments (photos are pasted on cardboard sheets) and individual photos gathered in three envelopes. The collection is bound together between quick binding covers.
The photos show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called.

2849009,"Photo on the album page   The photos come from the collections of the A. M. Luther factory (later TVMK) museum. In 2004, the company Ars Projekt OÜ signed an agreement with representatives of TVMK (Tallinn Vineeri- ja Möblikombinaat) to redesign the factory complex into a residential quarter. By that time, the historical factory was in a dilapidated state, the exhibits of the factory museum were neglected and scattered, in addition to this, the museum premises were said to have been flooded. The transferred materials also come from there. The transferor noticed the photos while exploring the premises of the factory and asked the customer's representative to use them to get to know the past of the historic building complex as thoroughly as possible. Since the customer had no interest and desire to preserve or exhibit the photos himself, the transferor considered it right to hand them over to the Architecture Museum (2008) after being used in the design. Anne Lass, chief treasurer of the Museum of Architecture, handed over the photos to the Estonian History Museum in October 2014 on the grounds that the material does not meet the collection principles of the Museum of Architecture.

The collection consists of album fragments (photos are pasted on cardboard sheets) and individual photos gathered in three envelopes. The collection is bound together between quick binding covers.
The photos show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s. The four oldest photos show the construction of the factory's new buildings in 1912. The most recent photos are from 1965 (4 pieces), which depict the events of the factory collective. A collection of album excerpts from the museum of the former Tallinn Vineeri- and Mööblikombinaat, bound in a swing binder. Contains 323 photos pasted on album pages from probably 7 different albums. The pictures show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s. The photo is pasted on the album page. The album pages are deformed, there are tears and bruises, the binding holes are broken.",photo

2079459,"[Pirita] river gorge with farmland, boats on the river.  glass negative. The (partial) collection of glass negatives that belonged to the heritage of home researcher and photo collector Valdeko Vende probably originally came from the premises of Suur-Karja 9 in Tallinn. Many glass negatives can be identified as being photographed by Alendander Teppor in the 1920s-1930s, who also had a photo studio in the same building in the second half of the 1930s. The negatives have been kept in the manufacturer's boxes, partly divided thematically. The notebooks in the boxes indicate that V.Vende has made contact copies of many of them.
The transferor Rita Hillermaa is the daughter of Valdeko Vende.
Content of the collection: Tallinn buildings and city views, Estonian orchestras and artists, athletes, action photography, nature views, photomontages, photography of works of art. Date: 1920s-1930s. 2 are flat film negatives, the rest are glass negatives. The negatives were photographed around 1925-1939. 100 negatives are of interest to the museum in terms of content. Among the remaining 184, there are unidentified landscape views, unsuccessful (foggy) architectural photography, action photography with the same person, many reproductions of photos, paintings, drawings, posters, sculptures with different content. However, primary is the collection value, as individual negatives may contain clues as to the original origin of the rest of the negatives. Transferred by: Rita Hillermaa. From Valdeko Vende's legacy. A piece is broken in the upper right corner, moisture damage in the lower right corner - loss of the emulsion.",photo negative

Grandfather was a cook in the Vigala manor and a servant to his wife. Around 1904, he ran a teahouse in Märjamaa. Either immediately after 1905 or later, the family moved to Tallinn, and the father had a watchmaker's workshop near Tartu mnt. When the Republic of Estonia was established, the family moved to Petseri, due to the health condition of the grandmother.
The negatives probably also have family pictures of Petser and interior views of the Mayer chemical factory in Tallinn, where Hugo Raud himself worked.  ",photo negative

The selection of souvenirs and gifts of the presidency was based on the identity of the presidency, which in turn came down to three overarching themes:
- Estonia as a digital country
- Estonian design
- Estonian food
In addition, practical and/or protocol restrictions were taken into account when choosing souvenirs and gifts:
- The gift with packaging must fit in hand luggage
- Gifts containing liquids can cause problems in air transport
- Giving away alcohol is not a good tone
- Glass, ceramics can break, leather can be culturally inappropriate
- Gifts could be gender neutral (except for ministers)
- Gifts could be practical
The concept of gifts was developed centrally by the State Chancellery, and all procurements were also carried out by the State Chancellery. Ministries could make their preferences from the selection of gifts/souvenirs proposed by the State Chancellery. Gifts with a distinctive solution were created for the guests of the parliamentary presidency of the Riigikogu. The selection of gifts was primarily based on the recipients of the gifts and their position. no. 2 Table signs and sign bases of countries and institutions. Radisson Blue, Radisson Olümpia, Nordic Hotel Forum, Swissotel and Hilton hotels in Tallinn were centrally equipped with background solutions throughout the presidency.

Biographical data:
Born on June 3, 1910 in Narva, where his father Gustav Birgi had a lemonade factory.
He started studying at the I Estonian primary school in the city of Narva. In the spring of 1923, the family (father, mother Miili (née Taska), younger sister Armilda (later Aade, married colonel Jakob Vende in 1938) and older half-brother Valter) moved to Elva. He graduated from the 7th grade of the upper primary school in Elva town in 1925, after which he moved to his uncle Eduard Taska's leather art studio to learn the trade. He worked there as a student in the educational workshop from 15.07.1925 to 27.09.1928, then he became a skilled worker in the field of book binding, hand gilding and artistic leather work. At the beginning of 1929, the office of materials storekeeper was added. At the beginning of 1937, he became assistant foreman. On June 12, 1937, he received a master's professional certificate in the field of bookbinding from the Tallinn Labor Skills Board, and at the beginning of 1938, he also took the position of master in Taska's studio.
SCOUTING ACTIVITIES already started in Elvas. In 1930 at the latest, he was a junior scoutmaster, and in March 1933 at the latest, the assistant leader of the Tallinn Scouts Maleva (the leader was a good friend of the skm Richard Treu (later represented: Tõnuri).
In 1933 he was promoted to Scoutmaster. In 1939, as a Scoutmaster, he received the Order of the Estonian Red Cross II class from the President of the Republic. medal.
In addition to work and his keen scouting hobby, he was also very versatile in other ways: on his free evenings, he bound his excellent library of nearly 400 volumes, made beautiful albums and leather goods for himself and as gifts; belonged to various associations, e.g. Private Library Owners' Association, Estonian-Czechoslovakian Association, etc., 1934 studied (or taught?) in an Esperanto course. In the summer of 1941, Viktor Birk was mobilized into the Red Army and taken to the Molotov (Perm) region, where he started working as a chef and later as a dining hall manager in a local ""trust"", as he calls it in his only surviving letter dated April 18, 1943. It was expected that the last Estonians left there would also be called to Teljabinsk - some to the division, some to work in their profession. But then all contact with him disappeared. Many years later, it was found out through the Red Cross that he had been arrested for some reason and died somewhere in a detention center in the Molotov region at the age of 34 on May 30, 1944. The death certificate obtained from Perm in 1957 states the standard ""failure of the heart"" as the cause of death.

Grandfather was a cook in the Vigala manor and a servant to his wife. Around 1904, he ran a teahouse in Märjamaa. Either immediately after 1905 or later, the family moved to Tallinn, and the father had a watchmaker's workshop near Tartu mnt. When the Republic of Estonia was established, the family moved to Petseri, due to the health condition of the grandmother.

The (partial) collection of glass negatives that belonged to the heritage of home researcher and photo collector Valdeko Vende probably originally came from the premises of Suur-Karja 9 in Tallinn. Many glass negatives can be identified as being photographed by Alendander Teppor in the 1920s-1930s, who also had a photo studio in the same building in the second half of the 1930s. The negatives have been kept in the manufacturer's boxes, partly divided thematically. The notebooks in the boxes indicate that V.Vende has made contact copies of many of them.
The transferor Rita Hillermaa is the daughter of Valdeko Vende.
Content of the collection: Tallinn buildings and city views, Estonian orchestras and artists, athletes, action photography, nature views, photomontages, photography of works of art. Date: 1920s-1930s. 2 are flat film negatives, the rest are glass negatives. The negatives were photographed around 1925-1939. 100 negatives are of interest to the museum in terms of content. Among the remaining 184, there are unidentified landscape views, unsuccessful (foggy) architectural photography, action photography with the same person, many reproductions of photos, paintings, drawings, posters, sculptures with different content. However, primary is the collection value, as individual negatives may contain clues as to the original origin of the rest of the negatives. Transferred by: Rita Hillermaa.

Million dollar gift to the history museum
Ivar Leimus

A few weeks ago, the employees of the Estonian History Museum dragged several exceptionally heavy suitcases, full of old Estonian money and official and merit badges, from the ship in Stockholm to the Tallinn quay. The event was both happy and sad. I was happy because the museum's collections were replenished to a very significant extent. For example, among the received paper money, there is an almost complete series of the first provisional means of payment of independent Estonia - 5% debt obligations of the Republic and bills of the State Treasury - a collection that cannot be put aside. Blue Crosses of Liberty, Eagle, White Star and Red Cross stars shine among the decorations, several unique military unit insignias, etc. are represented. A beautiful systematic collection of coins that have circulated in Estonia throughout history cannot be left out, among which the rare 9th-century dirhem of the Khazar state, the water ring minted in Riga during the time of Master of the Order Wolter von Plettenberg, the 1702 half ruble of Tsar Peter the Great, etc. attract attention at first glance.
It goes without saying that this is (despite the economic recession) a valuable collection, the price of which, based on the expertise carried out in Sweden, reaches well over a million Estonian kroons. Such gifts are not given every day. Or rather (apart from the works of art), no museum in Estonia has ever received such a generous donation.
And here we come to the sad part of the event. The valuable collection came to the museum as a legacy. On May 7, 2008, the meritorious collector Taavi Triumph died in Stockholm. The boy from Haapsalu arrived in Sweden during the storm in the autumn of 1944, lost his father, got an education abroad and a job at the prestigious Handelsbanken. Merging into the safe everyday life of the Swedish state, he remained an Estonian until the end, was an active scout, edited the wolf leaders' magazine ""Hiietule Ümber"", participated in a singing choir, translated, wrote journalism and, above all, collected and researched. Published by Taavi Triuphi in 1970-1980. years in the magazine ""Eesti Filatelist"" a series of meaningful and voluminous articles about Estonian money and decorations, his related exhibitions were always popular among Estonians in Sweden. As a long-term member of the Swedish Numismatic Society, he was awarded the society's gold merit pin last year to mark 40 years of activity. However, Taavi Triumph received the highest recognition, the White Star medal, in his home country, whose banking he helped to build.
Having known Taavit for almost the last twenty years, I know that collecting was not just a hobby for him, but his biggest passion, at least in that period of his life. And it deserves deep respect that at a time when some of our precious collections are being tried to make money in a hurry, a man who loved Estonia from the bottom of his heart decided to leave his most precious property to his homeland. The general public will be able to see pearls from the Taavi Triumph collection at a special exhibition at the history museum next year.

A stylized, romantic pastel portrait of the Estonian opera soloist (coloratura soprano) Ida Aav-Loo (1901 – 1997) depicts a mature and goal-oriented European ideal woman of the EW era, whose femininity is emphasized by soft shapes and a dreamy look into the distance. The color of the painting is soft, slightly diffused tones. For the background, the artist Ahas has used the same tone as for the portrait's eyes. In his heyday, in the 1930s, Aav-Loo was a popular performer on the opera stages of Latvia, Lithuania, Finland and Sweden. After emigrating in 1944, he continued his singing career in the USA, Canada and Australia. /text by Liisi Aibel/  ",

In 2004, the company Ars Projekt OÜ signed an agreement with representatives of TVMK (Tallinn Vineeri- ja Möblikombinaat) to redesign the factory complex into a residential quarter. By that time, the historical factory was in a dilapidated state, the exhibits of the factory museum were neglected and scattered, in addition to this, the museum premises were said to have been flooded. The transferred materials also come from there. The transferor noticed the photos while exploring the premises of the factory and asked the customer's representative to use them to get to know the past of the historic building complex as thoroughly as possible. Since the customer had no interest and desire to preserve or exhibit the photos himself, the transferor considered it right to hand them over to the Architecture Museum (2008) after being used in the design. Anne Lass, chief treasurer of the Museum of Architecture, handed over the photos to the Estonian History Museum in October 2014 on the grounds that the material does not meet the collection principles of the Museum of Architecture.

The collection consists of album fragments (photos are pasted on cardboard sheets) and individual photos gathered in three envelopes. The collection is bound together between quick binding covers.
The photos show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s. The four oldest photos show the construction of the factory's new buildings in 1912. The most recent photos are from 1965 (4 pieces), which depict the events of the factory collective. A collection of album excerpts from the museum of the former Tallinn Vineeri- and Mööblikombinaat, bound in a swing binder. Contains 323 photos pasted on album pages from probably 7 different albums. The pictures show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s.

Description: Views of Tallinn and Keila-Joa, industrial views, buildings, events in Tallinn, living conditions.

The Estonian History Museum grants the transferor the right to free use of photos taken of views of cinema buildings and interiors of Estonia before World War II in the museum's collections. Sports society Kalev, led by champion athlete and coach Richard Lauri, organized the first major race on September 20, 1959 in Tallinn on the Iru-Lükat-Kloostrimets circuit. Laur wanted to call it the Estonian grand race after the circuit races initiated by the motorcycle section of the Estonian Auto Club in 1933, but it did not go through. This is how the competition became the Kalevi Grand Race, which was dedicated for the first time to the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Tallinn, according to the custom of the time.

She made them when she was about 9-10 years old, when she could already knit and do needlework. He made the books later, in 1948. The dolls also once had a home with cardboard furniture, which unfortunately has been destroyed today.
H. Kendra was an ordinary child who grew up with her mother during the war. His father died in 1944. Hiie's mother was an accountant and Hiie himself studied to be an accountant. All his life, however, H. Kender worked as a tram driver. She continued to do beautiful needlework throughout her life. In addition, he read a lot (also in English), and his friends also remember him as an actor in the folk theater and an active lover of gardening and travel.

In 2004, the company Ars Projekt OÜ signed an agreement with representatives of TVMK (Tallinn Vineeri- ja Möblikombinaat) to redesign the factory complex into a residential quarter. By that time, the historical factory was in a dilapidated state, the exhibits of the factory museum were neglected and scattered, in addition to this, the museum premises were said to have been flooded. The transferred materials also come from there. The transferor noticed the photos while exploring the premises of the factory and asked the customer's representative to use them to get to know the past of the historic building complex as thoroughly as possible. Since the customer had no interest and desire to preserve or exhibit the photos himself, the transferor considered it right to hand them over to the Architecture Museum (2008) after being used in the design. Anne Lass, chief treasurer of the Museum of Architecture, handed over the photos to the Estonian History Museum in October 2014 on the grounds that the material does not meet the collection principles of the Museum of Architecture.

The collection consists of album fragments (photos are pasted on cardboard sheets) and individual photos gathered in three envelopes. The collection is bound together between quick binding covers.
The photos show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s. The four oldest photos show the construction of the factory's new buildings in 1912. The most recent photos are from 1965 (4 pieces), which depict the events of the factory collective. The series consists of 4 photos - photographed in 1912. in July. Depicts the construction of the stone buildings of the A. M. Luther plywood factory near Pärnu mnt and Vana-Lõuna street in Tallinn. 13 VII. 12.  ",

The 1/3 portrait painting of the Estonian composer, organist and choir director Rudolf Tobias (1873 – 1918) is a representative portrait in dark brown tones. Tobias's face is painted psychologically-realistically, his brow is wrinkled and the look in his eyes is suggestive. The portrait was probably made in the 1910s, when Tobias resided in Western Europe, mainly in Berlin, where he worked as both a journalist and organist, and from 1914 until his death as a professor of music theory at the Royal Academy of Music in Berlin. /text: Liisi Aibel/  ",

Nothing is known about his further fate, he probably lived to his natural end. It somehow ended up in the hands of K. Sarve's grandfather, Viktor Sarve, who in 1944 gave it to his family friends, Aino and Oskar Loid as war refugees, as a souvenir from their homeland. V. Sarv himself then went to fight against the Russians by Emajõki as a self-defence. He came back alive, got pragada from his wife, and together they went and buried the German machine gun in the forest near Abja.
Aino and Oskar Loit emigrated to Australia and still live in Sidney, an Estonian village. They sent Toosi back to Estonia in 2013 with the aim of donating it to the museum.  It is molded from elm and has a lid  ",

2849069,"Photo on the album page   The photos come from the collections of the A. M. Luther factory (later TVMK) museum. In 2004, the company Ars Projekt OÜ signed an agreement with representatives of TVMK (Tallinn Vineeri- ja Möblikombinaat) to redesign the factory complex into a residential quarter. By that time, the historical factory was in a dilapidated state, the exhibits of the factory museum were neglected and scattered, in addition to this, the museum premises were said to have been flooded. The transferred materials also come from there. The transferor noticed the photos while exploring the premises of the factory and asked the customer's representative to use them to get to know the past of the historic building complex as thoroughly as possible. Since the customer had no interest and desire to preserve or exhibit the photos himself, the transferor considered it right to hand them over to the Architecture Museum (2008) after being used in the design. Anne Lass, chief treasurer of the Museum of Architecture, handed over the photos to the Estonian History Museum in October 2014 on the grounds that the material does not meet the collection principles of the Museum of Architecture.

The collection consists of album fragments (photos are pasted on cardboard sheets) and individual photos gathered in three envelopes. The collection is bound together between quick binding covers.
The photos show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s. The four oldest photos show the construction of the factory's new buildings in 1912. The most recent photos are from 1965 (4 pieces), which depict the events of the factory collective. A collection of album excerpts from the museum of the former Tallinn Vineeri- and Mööblikombinaat, bound in a swing binder. Contains 323 photos pasted on album pages from probably 7 different albums. The pictures show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s. The photo is pasted on the album page. The album pages are deformed, there are tears and bruises, the binding holes are broken.",

In 2004, the company Ars Projekt OÜ signed an agreement with representatives of TVMK (Tallinn Vineeri- ja Möblikombinaat) to redesign the factory complex into a residential quarter. By that time, the historical factory was in a dilapidated state, the exhibits of the factory museum were neglected and scattered, in addition to this, the museum premises were said to have been flooded. The transferred materials also come from there. The transferor noticed the photos while exploring the premises of the factory and asked the customer's representative to use them to get to know the past of the historic building complex as thoroughly as possible. Since the customer had no interest and desire to preserve or exhibit the photos himself, the transferor considered it right to hand them over to the Architecture Museum (2008) after being used in the design. Anne Lass, chief treasurer of the Museum of Architecture, handed over the photos to the Estonian History Museum in October 2014 on the grounds that the material does not meet the collection principles of the Museum of Architecture.

The collection consists of album fragments (photos are pasted on cardboard sheets) and individual photos gathered in three envelopes. The collection is bound together between quick binding covers.
The photos show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s. The four oldest photos show the construction of the factory's new buildings in 1912. The most recent photos are from 1965 (4 pieces), which depict the events of the factory collective. A collection of album excerpts from the museum of the former Tallinn Vineeri- and Mööblikombinaat, bound in a swing binder. Contains 323 photos pasted on album pages from probably 7 different albums. The pictures show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s.

Million dollar gift to the history museum
Ivar Leimus

A few weeks ago, the employees of the Estonian History Museum dragged several exceptionally heavy suitcases, full of old Estonian money and official and merit badges, from the ship in Stockholm to the Tallinn quay. The event was both happy and sad. I was happy because the museum's collections were replenished to a very significant extent. For example, among the received paper money, there is an almost complete series of the first provisional means of payment of independent Estonia - 5% debt obligations of the Republic and bills of the State Treasury - a collection that cannot be put aside. Blue Crosses of Liberty, Eagle, White Star and Red Cross stars shine among the decorations, several unique military unit insignias, etc. are represented. A beautiful systematic collection of coins that have circulated in Estonia throughout history cannot be left out, among which the rare 9th-century dirhem of the Khazar state, the water ring minted in Riga during the time of Master of the Order Wolter von Plettenberg, the 1702 half ruble of Tsar Peter the Great, etc. attract attention at first glance.
It goes without saying that this is (despite the economic recession) a valuable collection, the price of which, based on the expertise carried out in Sweden, reaches well over a million Estonian kroons. Such gifts are not given every day. Or rather (apart from the works of art), no museum in Estonia has ever received such a generous donation.
And here we come to the sad part of the event. The valuable collection came to the museum as a legacy. On May 7, 2008, the meritorious collector Taavi Triumph died in Stockholm. The boy from Haapsalu arrived in Sweden during the storm in the autumn of 1944, lost his father, got an education abroad and a job at the prestigious Handelsbanken. Merging into the safe everyday life of the Swedish state, he remained an Estonian until the end, was an active scout, edited the wolf leaders' magazine ""Hiietule Ümber"", participated in a singing choir, translated, wrote journalism and, above all, collected and researched. Published by Taavi Triuphi in 1970-1980. years in the magazine ""Eesti Filatelist"" a series of meaningful and voluminous articles about Estonian money and decorations, his related exhibitions were always popular among Estonians in Sweden. As a long-term member of the Swedish Numismatic Society, he was awarded the society's gold merit pin last year to mark 40 years of activity. However, Taavi Triumph received the highest recognition, the White Star medal, in his home country, whose banking he helped to build.
Having known Taavit for almost the last twenty years, I know that collecting was not just a hobby for him, but his biggest passion, at least in that period of his life. And it deserves deep respect that at a time when some of our precious collections are being tried to make money in a hurry, a man who loved Estonia from the bottom of his heart decided to leave his most precious property to his homeland. The general public will be able to see pearls from the Taavi Triumph collection at a special exhibition at the history museum next year.

2848951,"Interior view of A. M. Luther factory - production equipment   The photos come from the collections of the A. M. Luther factory (later TVMK) museum. In 2004, the company Ars Projekt OÜ signed an agreement with representatives of TVMK (Tallinn Vineeri- ja Möblikombinaat) to redesign the factory complex into a residential quarter. By that time, the historical factory was in a dilapidated state, the exhibits of the factory museum were neglected and scattered, in addition to this, the museum premises were said to have been flooded. The transferred materials also come from there. The transferor noticed the photos while exploring the premises of the factory and asked the customer's representative to use them to get to know the past of the historic building complex as thoroughly as possible. Since the customer had no interest and desire to preserve or exhibit the photos himself, the transferor considered it right to hand them over to the Architecture Museum (2008) after being used in the design. Anne Lass, chief treasurer of the Museum of Architecture, handed over the photos to the Estonian History Museum in October 2014 on the grounds that the material does not meet the collection principles of the Museum of Architecture.

The collection consists of album fragments (photos are pasted on cardboard sheets) and individual photos gathered in three envelopes. The collection is bound together between quick binding covers.
The photos show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s. The four oldest photos show the construction of the factory's new buildings in 1912. The most recent photos are from 1965 (4 pieces), which depict the events of the factory collective. A collection of album excerpts from the museum of the former Tallinn Vineeri- and Mööblikombinaat, bound in a swing binder. Contains 323 photos pasted on album pages from probably 7 different albums. The pictures show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s. The photo is pasted on the album page. The album pages are deformed, there are tears and bruises, the binding holes are broken.",
