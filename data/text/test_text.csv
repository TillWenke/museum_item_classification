The selection of souvenirs and gifts of the presidency was based on the identity of the presidency, which in turn came down to three overarching themes:
- Estonia as a digital country
- Estonian design
- Estonian food
In addition, practical and/or protocol restrictions were taken into account when choosing souvenirs and gifts:
- The gift with packaging must fit in hand luggage
- Gifts containing liquids can cause problems in air transport
- Giving away alcohol is not a good tone
- Glass, ceramics can break, leather can be culturally inappropriate
- Gifts could be gender neutral (except for ministers)
- Gifts could be practical
The concept of gifts was developed centrally by the State Chancellery, and all procurements were also carried out by the State Chancellery. Ministries could make their preferences from the selection of gifts/souvenirs proposed by the State Chancellery. Gifts with a distinctive solution were created for the guests of the parliamentary presidency of the Riigikogu. The selection of gifts was primarily based on the recipients of the gifts and their position. no. 2 Table signs and sign bases of countries and institutions. Radisson Blue, Radisson Olümpia, Nordic Hotel Forum, Swissotel and Hilton hotels in Tallinn were centrally equipped with background solutions throughout the presidency.

Biographical data:
Born on June 3, 1910 in Narva, where his father Gustav Birgi had a lemonade factory.
He started studying at the I Estonian primary school in the city of Narva. In the spring of 1923, the family (father, mother Miili (née Taska), younger sister Armilda (later Aade, married colonel Jakob Vende in 1938) and older half-brother Valter) moved to Elva. He graduated from the 7th grade of the upper primary school in Elva town in 1925, after which he moved to his uncle Eduard Taska's leather art studio to learn the trade. He worked there as a student in the educational workshop from 15.07.1925 to 27.09.1928, then he became a skilled worker in the field of book binding, hand gilding and artistic leather work. At the beginning of 1929, the office of materials storekeeper was added. At the beginning of 1937, he became assistant foreman. On June 12, 1937, he received a master's professional certificate in the field of bookbinding from the Tallinn Labor Skills Board, and at the beginning of 1938, he also took the position of master in Taska's studio.
SCOUTING ACTIVITIES already started in Elvas. In 1930 at the latest, he was a junior scoutmaster, and in March 1933 at the latest, the assistant leader of the Tallinn Scouts Maleva (the leader was a good friend of the skm Richard Treu (later represented: Tõnuri).
In 1933 he was promoted to Scoutmaster. In 1939, as a Scoutmaster, he received the Order of the Estonian Red Cross II class from the President of the Republic. medal.
In addition to work and his keen scouting hobby, he was also very versatile in other ways: on his free evenings, he bound his excellent library of nearly 400 volumes, made beautiful albums and leather goods for himself and as gifts; belonged to various associations, e.g. Private Library Owners' Association, Estonian-Czechoslovakian Association, etc., 1934 studied (or taught?) in an Esperanto course. In the summer of 1941, Viktor Birk was mobilized into the Red Army and taken to the Molotov (Perm) region, where he started working as a chef and later as a dining hall manager in a local ""trust"", as he calls it in his only surviving letter dated April 18, 1943. It was expected that the last Estonians left there would also be called to Teljabinsk - some to the division, some to work in their profession. But then all contact with him disappeared. Many years later, it was found out through the Red Cross that he had been arrested for some reason and died somewhere in a detention center in the Molotov region at the age of 34 on May 30, 1944. The death certificate obtained from Perm in 1957 states the standard ""failure of the heart"" as the cause of death.

Grandfather was a cook in the Vigala manor and a servant to his wife. Around 1904, he ran a teahouse in Märjamaa. Either immediately after 1905 or later, the family moved to Tallinn, and the father had a watchmaker's workshop near Tartu mnt.

The (partial) collection of glass negatives that belonged to the heritage of home researcher and photo collector Valdeko Vende probably originally came from the premises of Suur-Karja 9 in Tallinn. Many glass negatives can be identified as being photographed by Alendander Teppor in the 1920s-1930s, who also had a photo studio in the same building in the second half of the 1930s. The negatives have been kept in the manufacturer's boxes, partly divided thematically. The notebooks in the boxes indicate that V.Vende has made contact copies of many of them.
The transferor Rita Hillermaa is the daughter of Valdeko Vende.
Content of the collection: Tallinn buildings and city views, Estonian orchestras and artists, athletes, action photography, nature views, photomontages, photography of works of art. Date: 1920s-1930s. 2 are flat film negatives, the rest are glass negatives. The negatives were photographed around 1925-1939. 100 negatives are of interest to the museum in terms of content. Among the remaining 184, there are unidentified landscape views, unsuccessful (foggy) architectural photography, action photography with the same person, many reproductions of photos, paintings, drawings, posters, sculptures with different content. However, primary is the collection value, as individual negatives may contain clues as to the original origin of the rest of the negatives. Transferred by: Rita Hillermaa.

Million dollar gift to the history museum
Ivar Leimus

A few weeks ago, the employees of the Estonian History Museum dragged several exceptionally heavy suitcases, full of old Estonian money and official and merit badges, from the ship in Stockholm to the Tallinn quay. The event was both happy and sad. I was happy because the museum's collections were replenished to a very significant extent. For example, among the received paper money, there is an almost complete series of the first provisional means of payment of independent Estonia - 5% debt obligations of the Republic and bills of the State Treasury - a collection that cannot be put aside. Blue Crosses of Liberty, Eagle, White Star and Red Cross stars shine among the decorations, several unique military unit insignias, etc. are represented. A beautiful systematic collection of coins that have circulated in Estonia throughout history cannot be left out, among which the rare 9th-century dirhem of the Khazar state, the water ring minted in Riga during the time of Master of the Order Wolter von Plettenberg, the 1702 half ruble of Tsar Peter the Great, etc. attract attention at first glance.
It goes without saying that this is (despite the economic recession) a valuable collection, the price of which, based on the expertise carried out in Sweden, reaches well over a million Estonian kroons. Such gifts are not given every day. Or rather (apart from the works of art), no museum in Estonia has ever received such a generous donation.
And here we come to the sad part of the event. The valuable collection came to the museum as a legacy. On May 7, 2008, the meritorious collector Taavi Triumph died in Stockholm. The boy from Haapsalu arrived in Sweden during the storm in the autumn of 1944, lost his father, got an education abroad and a job at the prestigious Handelsbanken. Merging into the safe everyday life of the Swedish state, he remained an Estonian until the end, was an active scout, edited the wolf leaders' magazine ""Hiietule Ümber"", participated in a singing choir, translated, wrote journalism and, above all, collected and researched. Published by Taavi Triuphi in 1970-1980. years in the magazine ""Eesti Filatelist"" a series of meaningful and voluminous articles about Estonian money and decorations, his related exhibitions were always popular among Estonians in Sweden. As a long-term member of the Swedish Numismatic Society, he was awarded the society's gold merit pin last year to mark 40 years of activity. However, Taavi Triumph received the highest recognition, the White Star medal, in his home country, whose banking he helped to build.
Having known Taavit for almost the last twenty years, I know that collecting was not just a hobby for him, but his biggest passion, at least in that period of his life. And it deserves deep respect that at a time when some of our precious collections are being tried to make money in a hurry, a man who loved Estonia from the bottom of his heart decided to leave his most precious property to his homeland. The general public will be able to see pearls from the Taavi Triumph collection at a special exhibition at the history museum next year.

A stylized, romantic pastel portrait of the Estonian opera soloist (coloratura soprano) Ida Aav-Loo (1901 – 1997) depicts a mature and goal-oriented European ideal woman of the EW era, whose femininity is emphasized by soft shapes and a dreamy look into the distance. The color of the painting is soft, slightly diffused tones. For the background, the artist Ahas has used the same tone as for the portrait's eyes. In his heyday, in the 1930s, Aav-Loo was a popular performer on the opera stages of Latvia, Lithuania, Finland and Sweden. After emigrating in 1944, he continued his singing career in the USA, Canada and Australia. /text by Liisi Aibel/",,test

In 2004, the company Ars Projekt OÜ signed an agreement with representatives of TVMK (Tallinn Vineeri- ja Möblikombinaat) to redesign the factory complex into a residential quarter. By that time, the historical factory was in a dilapidated state, the exhibits of the factory museum were neglected and scattered, in addition to this, the museum premises were said to have been flooded. The transferred materials also come from there. The transferor noticed the photos while exploring the premises of the factory and asked the customer's representative to use them to get to know the past of the historic building complex as thoroughly as possible. Since the customer had no interest and desire to preserve or exhibit the photos himself, the transferor considered it right to hand them over to the Architecture Museum (2008) after being used in the design. Anne Lass, chief treasurer of the Museum of Architecture, handed over the photos to the Estonian History Museum in October 2014 on the grounds that the material does not meet the collection principles of the Museum of Architecture.

The collection consists of album fragments (photos are pasted on cardboard sheets) and individual photos gathered in three envelopes. The collection is bound together between quick binding covers.
The photos show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s. The four oldest photos show the construction of the factory's new buildings in 1912. The most recent photos are from 1965 (4 pieces), which depict the events of the factory collective. A collection of album excerpts from the museum of the former Tallinn Vineeri- and Mööblikombinaat, bound in a swing binder. Contains 323 photos pasted on album pages from probably 7 different albums. The pictures show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s.

3253194,"Doll school bag   Hiie Kendra (born 1934-deceased) made the dolls and their clothes (plus books and a school bag made a few years later) under the guidance of her mother. She made them when she was about 9-10 years old, when she could already knit and do needlework. He made the books later, in 1948. The dolls also once had a home with cardboard furniture, which unfortunately has been destroyed today.
H. Kendra was an ordinary child who grew up with her mother during the war. His father died in 1944. Hiie's mother was an accountant and Hiie himself studied to be an accountant. All his life, however, H. Kender worked as a tram driver. She continued to do beautiful needlework throughout her life. In addition, he read a lot (also in English), and his friends also remember him as an actor in the folk theater and an active lover of gardening and travel.

2839211,"Construction of the A. M. Luther factory buildings in 1912   The photos come from the collections of the A. M. Luther factory (later TVMK) museum. In 2004, the company Ars Projekt OÜ signed an agreement with representatives of TVMK (Tallinn Vineeri- ja Möblikombinaat) to redesign the factory complex into a residential quarter. By that time, the historical factory was in a dilapidated state, the exhibits of the factory museum were neglected and scattered, in addition to this, the museum premises were said to have been flooded. The transferred materials also come from there. The transferor noticed the photos while exploring the premises of the factory and asked the customer's representative to use them to get to know the past of the historic building complex as thoroughly as possible. Since the customer had no interest and desire to preserve or exhibit the photos himself, the transferor considered it right to hand them over to the Architecture Museum (2008) after being used in the design. Anne Lass, chief treasurer of the Museum of Architecture, handed over the photos to the Estonian History Museum in October 2014 on the grounds that the material does not meet the collection principles of the Museum of Architecture.

The collection consists of album fragments (photos are pasted on cardboard sheets) and individual photos gathered in three envelopes. The collection is bound together between quick binding covers.
The photos show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s.

Tobias's face is painted psychologically-realistically, his brow is wrinkled and the look in his eyes is suggestive. The portrait was probably made in the 1910s, when Tobias resided in Western Europe, mainly in Berlin, where he worked as both a journalist and organist, and from 1914 until his death as a professor of music theory at the Royal Academy of Music in Berlin. /text: Liisi Aibel/",,test

2849069,"Photo on the album page   The photos come from the collections of the A. M. Luther factory (later TVMK) museum. In 2004, the company Ars Projekt OÜ signed an agreement with representatives of TVMK (Tallinn Vineeri- ja Möblikombinaat) to redesign the factory complex into a residential quarter. By that time, the historical factory was in a dilapidated state, the exhibits of the factory museum were neglected and scattered, in addition to this, the museum premises were said to have been flooded. The transferred materials also come from there. The transferor noticed the photos while exploring the premises of the factory and asked the customer's representative to use them to get to know the past of the historic building complex as thoroughly as possible. Since the customer had no interest and desire to preserve or exhibit the photos himself, the transferor considered it right to hand them over to the Architecture Museum (2008) after being used in the design. Anne Lass, chief treasurer of the Museum of Architecture, handed over the photos to the Estonian History Museum in October 2014 on the grounds that the material does not meet the collection principles of the Museum of Architecture.

The collection consists of album fragments (photos are pasted on cardboard sheets) and individual photos gathered in three envelopes. The collection is bound together between quick binding covers.
The photos show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s. The four oldest photos show the construction of the factory's new buildings in 1912. The most recent photos are from 1965 (4 pieces), which depict the events of the factory collective. A collection of album excerpts from the museum of the former Tallinn Vineeri- and Mööblikombinaat, bound in a swing binder. Contains 323 photos pasted on album pages from probably 7 different albums. The pictures show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s.

2848918,"Interior view of A. M. Luther factory - worker at saw   The photos come from the collections of the A. M. Luther factory (later TVMK) museum. In 2004, the company Ars Projekt OÜ signed an agreement with representatives of TVMK (Tallinn Vineeri- ja Möblikombinaat) to redesign the factory complex into a residential quarter. By that time, the historical factory was in a dilapidated state, the exhibits of the factory museum were neglected and scattered, in addition to this, the museum premises were said to have been flooded. The transferred materials also come from there. The transferor noticed the photos while exploring the premises of the factory and asked the customer's representative to use them to get to know the past of the historic building complex as thoroughly as possible. Since the customer had no interest and desire to preserve or exhibit the photos himself, the transferor considered it right to hand them over to the Architecture Museum (2008) after being used in the design. Anne Lass, chief treasurer of the Museum of Architecture, handed over the photos to the Estonian History Museum in October 2014 on the grounds that the material does not meet the collection principles of the Museum of Architecture.

The collection consists of album fragments (photos are pasted on cardboard sheets) and individual photos gathered in three envelopes. The collection is bound together between quick binding covers.
The photos show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s. The four oldest photos show the construction of the factory's new buildings in 1912. The most recent photos are from 1965 (4 pieces), which depict the events of the factory collective. A collection of album excerpts from the museum of the former Tallinn Vineeri- and Mööblikombinaat, bound in a swing binder. Contains 323 photos pasted on album pages from probably 7 different albums. The pictures show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s.

Million dollar gift to the history museum
Ivar Leimus

A few weeks ago, the employees of the Estonian History Museum dragged several exceptionally heavy suitcases, full of old Estonian money and official and merit badges, from the ship in Stockholm to the Tallinn quay. The event was both happy and sad. I was happy because the museum's collections were replenished to a very significant extent. For example, among the received paper money, there is an almost complete series of the first provisional means of payment of independent Estonia - 5% debt obligations of the Republic and bills of the State Treasury - a collection that cannot be put aside. Blue Crosses of Liberty, Eagle, White Star and Red Cross stars shine among the decorations, several unique military unit insignias, etc. are represented. A beautiful systematic collection of coins that have circulated in Estonia throughout history cannot be left out, among which the rare 9th-century dirhem of the Khazar state, the water ring minted in Riga during the time of Master of the Order Wolter von Plettenberg, the 1702 half ruble of Tsar Peter the Great, etc. attract attention at first glance.
It goes without saying that this is (despite the economic recession) a valuable collection, the price of which, based on the expertise carried out in Sweden, reaches well over a million Estonian kroons. Such gifts are not given every day. Or rather (apart from the works of art), no museum in Estonia has ever received such a generous donation.
And here we come to the sad part of the event. The valuable collection came to the museum as a legacy. On May 7, 2008, the meritorious collector Taavi Triumph died in Stockholm. The boy from Haapsalu arrived in Sweden during the storm in the autumn of 1944, lost his father, got an education abroad and a job at the prestigious Handelsbanken. Merging into the safe everyday life of the Swedish state, he remained an Estonian until the end, was an active scout, edited the wolf leaders' magazine ""Hiietule Ümber"", participated in a singing choir, translated, wrote journalism and, above all, collected and researched. Published by Taavi Triuphi in 1970-1980. years in the magazine ""Eesti Filatelist"" a series of meaningful and voluminous articles about Estonian money and decorations, his related exhibitions were always popular among Estonians in Sweden. As a long-term member of the Swedish Numismatic Society, he was awarded the society's gold merit pin last year to mark 40 years of activity. However, Taavi Triumph received the highest recognition, the White Star medal, in his home country, whose banking he helped to build.
Having known Taavit for almost the last twenty years, I know that collecting was not just a hobby for him, but his biggest passion, at least in that period of his life. And it deserves deep respect that at a time when some of our precious collections are being tried to make money in a hurry, a man who loved Estonia from the bottom of his heart decided to leave his most precious property to his homeland. The general public will be able to see pearls from the Taavi Triumph collection at a special exhibition at the history museum next year.

2848951,"Interior view of A. M. Luther factory - production equipment   The photos come from the collections of the A. M. Luther factory (later TVMK) museum. In 2004, the company Ars Projekt OÜ signed an agreement with representatives of TVMK (Tallinn Vineeri- ja Möblikombinaat) to redesign the factory complex into a residential quarter. By that time, the historical factory was in a dilapidated state, the exhibits of the factory museum were neglected and scattered, in addition to this, the museum premises were said to have been flooded. The transferred materials also come from there. The transferor noticed the photos while exploring the premises of the factory and asked the customer's representative to use them to get to know the past of the historic building complex as thoroughly as possible. Since the customer had no interest and desire to preserve or exhibit the photos himself, the transferor considered it right to hand them over to the Architecture Museum (2008) after being used in the design. Anne Lass, chief treasurer of the Museum of Architecture, handed over the photos to the Estonian History Museum in October 2014 on the grounds that the material does not meet the collection principles of the Museum of Architecture.

The collection consists of album fragments (photos are pasted on cardboard sheets) and individual photos gathered in three envelopes. The collection is bound together between quick binding covers.
The photos show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called. Luther's pool in Tallinn Minisadama, interior and exterior views of factory buildings, plywood making and other production processes, employees and product samples mainly from the late 1920s to the late 1930s. The four oldest photos show the construction of the factory's new buildings in 1912. The most recent photos are from 1965 (4 pieces), which depict the events of the factory collective. A collection of album excerpts from the museum of the former Tallinn Vineeri- and Mööblikombinaat, bound in a swing binder. Contains 323 photos pasted on album pages from probably 7 different albums. The pictures show the raw material transport of the A. M. Luther factory, so-called.
